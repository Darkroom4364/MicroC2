This project proposes the design of a lightweight C2 framework for penetration testing and red team operations, emphasizing stealth and a low system footprint. The framework will utilize covert communication, encryption, and obfuscation to evade detection by security tools like EDR and IDS. Its effectiveness will be evaluated in simulated environments, offering insights into evasion techniques and improving defensive strategies.

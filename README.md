## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations and Security Considerations

Developed under academic constraints (timeline, research focus, lab testing), this framework prioritizes proof-of-concept over production-ready security.

**Key Limitations:**
- Incomplete input validation.
- Basic error handling.
- Research-grade cryptographic implementations.
- Functionality-focused network security (not hardened).
- Basic authentication.
- Limited operational logging/monitoring.

**For Authorized Testing:**
- Use ONLY in isolated, air-gapped environments.
- Implement robust monitoring and logging.
- Secure explicit written authorization.
- Adhere to institutional research protocols.
- Coordinate with network/security teams.

## üîß Technical Documentation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Go** (v1.20+ recommended)
- **Rust** (for agent builds)
- **Node.js & npm** (for web UI development, if you plan to modify frontend)
- **Git** (to clone the repository)
- **MinGW-w64** (for cross-compiling Windows agents from Linux)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MicroC2.git
   cd MicroC2
   ```
2. **Build the server:**
   ```sh
   cd server
   go build -o server ./cmd/server.go
   ```
3. **Build the agent (optionally use cargo strip to reduce compile build as much as possible):**
   ```sh
   cd ../agent
   cargo build --release
   ```
4. **Build the agent for Windows (from Linux):**
   - Install MinGW-w64:
     ```sh
     sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install mingw-w64
     ```
   - Ensure the import library for Iphlpapi is available and symlinked:
     ```sh
     sudo ln -sf /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib/libiphlpapi.a /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib/libIphlpapi.a
     ```

### Running the Server
1. **Start the server:**
   ```sh
   cd server
   ./server
   ```
2. **Access the web interface:**
   - Open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:8080/home/](http://localhost:8080/home/) (or the port you configured).

### Configuration
- Edit `server/config/settings.yaml` for server settings.
- Edit `agent/src/config.rs` or use environment variables for agent configuration.

### TLS certificates for using HTTPS
- Run the following in MicroC2/server/ to generate TLS certificates
    ```
    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout certs/server.key -out certs/server.crt -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=localhost"
    ```

### Creating Listeners
- Use the web UI to create HTTP Polling or SOCKS5 listeners.
- Agents will connect to the listener endpoints you configure.

### Building Payloads
- Use the Payload Generator in the web UI to generate agent binaries for your target OS/architecture.

### File Drop
    - Upload and download files via the File Drop section in the web UI. Folder in codebase is MicroC2/server/uploads/

## SOCKS5 Proxy Pivoting Setup (Multi-Hop Example)

MicroC2 supports SOCKS5 proxy pivoting, including multi-hop scenarios. Below is a tested workflow for chaining agents and listeners to pivot through multiple internal hosts.

### Topology Example

```
Client <-> Server <-> VM1 <-> VM2
```

- **Server**: Runs MicroC2 server and first agent (pivot entry point)
- **VM1**: First virtual machine, runs agent and acts as a SOCKS5 pivot server and uses a socks reverse proxy to connect to the c2 server
- **VM2**: second virtual machine, runs second agent

---

### Step-by-Step Workflow

#### 1. **Set Up Two SOCKS5 Listeners**

- In the MicroC2 web UI, create two SOCKS5 listeners (everything apart from URI setup is free to be configured): 
  - **Listener 1**: For the agent on VM1 (e.g., port 8443)
  - **Listener 2**: For the agent on VM2 (e.g., port 8444)

#### 2. **Deploy and Configure Agents**

- **On VM1:**
  - Build an agent payload in the web UI, enabling SOCKS5 configuration.
  - Set the SOCKS5 proxy host/port to point to the MicroC2 server and Listener 1.
  - Deploy and run the agent on VM1.
  - Start the SOCKS5 pivot on VM1:
    ```sh
    pivot_start 1080
    ```
  - (Optional) Start SSH if needed for port forwarding on c2 server and pivot server:
    ```sh
    sudo systemctl start ssh
    ```
  - and connect on the agent side with
    ```sh
    ssh -N -D SOCKS5_PROXY_PORT ServerUsername@ServerIP
    ```

- **On VM2:**
  - Build a second agent payload, configuring it to use VM1 as its SOCKS5 proxy (host: 127.0.0.1, port: 1080).
  - Deploy and run the agent on VM2.
  - Start the SOCKS5 pivot on VM2:
    ```sh
    pivot_start 1081
    ```
  - SSH from VM2 to VM1 if needed:
    ```sh
    ssh -N -D VM1_PROXY_PORT Vm1Username@IPofVm1
    ```
